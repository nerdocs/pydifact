"""
This file contains common used classes described in the EDIFACT syntax.

There are multiple versions (1-4) of the EDIFACT standard, and each differ slightly.
As one project will probably never use more than one syntax version simultaneously,
it is splitted into 4 different python files, each which could be imported using

    from pydifact.syntax.v[1..4] import ...

herby providing the same structure.
